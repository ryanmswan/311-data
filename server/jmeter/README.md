### Quick Start
Run the test script from this directory to perform a jmeter test that hits all of the content endpoints with valid params.
```
chmod +x test.sh && ./test.sh
```

### File types
`.jmx` -- these are test plans. They can be created and edited using the jmeter GUI.

`.jtl` -- test reports. Created by running test plans.

`report/*` -- graphical reports generated by running test plans.

### Commands
Run these commands from this directory.

#### open jmeter GUI
Run `jmeter` to start jmeter in GUI mode. This will open a window where you can create and edit test plans. To open a test plan for editing, choose Open from the file menu and select the plan in the finder.

#### run tests and generate html report
Once you have a test plan, you can run the tests from the command line like this:
```
jmeter -n -t {PLAN_NAME}.jmx -l {REPORT_NAME}.jtl -e -o html/{HTML_REPORT_NAME}
```
This will produce a report file (ending in `.jtl`) and an html report that you can view in the browser.

#### generate html report from existing .jtl file
If you already have a report file, you can create an html report from it by running:
```
jmeter -g {JTL_FILE_NAME} -o html/{HTML_REPORT_NAME}
```
