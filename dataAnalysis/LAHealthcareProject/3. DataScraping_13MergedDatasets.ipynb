    "#### Objectives: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) To compare LA vs State of California on quality and quantity of Healthcare\n",
    "\n",
    "2) To analyse Healthcare Projects, Expenditures, Facilities, Medically Underserved Areas+Populations, Healthcare Shorgates across counties (causation-correlation)\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Further analysis on how Medically Underserved Areas+Populations, Healthcare Shortages impact the overall well-being of LA community (causation-correlation)\n",
    "\n",
    "4) To perform geospatial analysis using Open Location Code (OLC) for granular location classification.\n",

    "#### Details for Total of 13 Merged Datasets- 3 parts\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Since most statewide datasets have County/City level for location, we will combine with LA datasets to obtain Latitude-Longitude, Zipcodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Scraping and Merging will provide us benefits of flexible multi-cross-correlation analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Some Columns are renamed for readability and simplicity.\n",
